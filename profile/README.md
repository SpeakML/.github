Speak is on a <b>🚀 mission</b>, building the easiest, lightiest, best written in Rust <b><i>machine-learning based chatbot</b></i> 🗣️. (With plans of remaking it in other languages). Speak is the tool that brings everyone a way to chat with a machine naturally, without <a href="https://youtu.be/sFZjqVnWBhc">sounding robotic</a> or ***just*** saying templates, but creating **natural** phrases **word by word!**.

###### Currently I'm designing the algorithm, that's why I created another repository for the design, written in Python, because designing things in Python is faster and easier than creating them directly with Rust. [Speak secondary repo](https://github.com/speakml/speak.py)
